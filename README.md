# Industrial-Management
Industrial Management is run by the Business School for students in the College of Science and Engineering. The course is designed to assist non-specialist students to acquire understanding of business organisations and management processes, and their relevance in complementing technical skills. The course is designed both to be self-contained for those who do not intend to study the subject further, and to complement Techniques of Management for Scientists and Engineers and other business courses that may be undertaken within Science and Engineering for accreditation purposes.

## Module Objectives
To introduce some of the fundamental tools and concepts of microeconomics which are useful for solving economic problems and in assisting managerial decisions.

## Module Aims
To teach core principles in a way that is accessible to students with basic mathematical background (calculus) and none or little economic knowledge; to provide a tutorial which allows for the learning of economics through the practice of economics, to provide an examination which gives the appropriate incentive to students.

The lecture slides are made by Impress.js.
